## Introduction

About 75% of the energy used to generate electricity in the US goes to [waste](https://www.edf.org/card/6-ways-cut-big-waste-our-energy-system?card=1) costing roughly $260 billion annualy. Sadly, over 80% of the electricity is generated from non-renewable [sources](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3) taking a massive toll on the environment. With such appaling figures there is plenty of room for improvement, but it requires careful analysis to identify the most viable options. Performing such analysis often involves multiple, diverse datasets.
